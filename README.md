# Generalized Assignment Problem

## About 

This project was build during Computational Intelligence class at my university. In this project an implementation Simulated Annealing Algorithm is used to find the solutions for Generalized Assigment Problem instances.

## Structure

- *GeneralizedAssignmentProblemSolution* is a record containing the solution for a given Generalized Assignment Problem instance
- *Main* class is responsible for running the project
- *SimulatedAnnealing* class contains an implementation of Simulated Annealing algorithm
- *testData* directory contains various instances of Generalized Assigment Problem (*GAP*)
- *results* directory contains a CSV file with solution to the different instances of GAP
